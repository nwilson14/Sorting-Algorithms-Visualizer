# Sorting-Algorithms-Visualizer

This program contains sorting algorithms and a visualizer to help see how each
algorithm works. It contains an initial UI where the user can select which sorting
algorithm they want to see. 

I was inspired to create this program by these two videos:

The second video is by Clement Mihailescu who I have been watching on Youtube for a
while. So thank you to him for the idea! I tried to add my own twist on the project
so it was not a copy of his!

NOTE: I was fairly new to pygame; the only project I did with pygame was in my Programming
In a Second Language class, last semester. So I did have to do some research when I was
creating the visualizer.
